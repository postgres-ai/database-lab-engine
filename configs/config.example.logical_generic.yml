# Data retrieval flow. This section defines both initial retrieval, and rules
# to keep the data directory in a synchronized state with the source. Both are optional:
# you may already have the data directory, so neither initial retrieval nor
# synchronization are needed.
# 
# Data retrieval can be also considered as "thick" cloning. Once it's done, users
# can use "thin" cloning to get independent full-size clones of the database in
# seconds, for testing and development. Normally, retrieval (thick cloning) is
# a slow operation (1 TiB/h is a good speed). Optionally, the process of keeping
# the Database Lab data directory in sync with the source (being continuously
# updated) can be configured.
#
# There are two basic ways to organize data retrieval:
#  - "logical":  use dump/restore processes, obtaining a logical copy of the initial
#                database (a sequence  of SQL commands), and then loading it to
#                the target Database Lab data directory. This is the only option
#                for managed cloud PostgreSQL services such as Amazon RDS. Physically,
#                the copy of the database created using this method differs from
#                the original one (data blocks are stored differently). However,
#                row counts are the same, as well as internal database statistics,
#                allowing to do various kinds of development and testing, including
#                running EXPLAIN command to optimize SQL queries.
#  - "physical": physically copy the data directory from the source (or from the
#                archive if a physical backup tool such as WAL-G, pgBackRest, or Barman
#                is used). This approach allows having a copy of the original database
#                which is physically identical, including the existing bloat, data
#                blocks location. Not supported for managed cloud Postgres services
#                such as Amazon RDS.
