      summary: Reset a clone
      description: "Reset the specified clone to a previously stored state.
        This can be done by specifying a particular snapshot ID or using the 'latest' flag.
        All changes made after the snapshot are discarded during the reset, unless those
        changes were preserved in a snapshot. All database connections will be reset,
        requiring users and applications to reconnect. The duration of the reset operation
        is comparable to the creation of a new clone. However, unlike creating a new clone,
        the reset operation retains the database credentials and does not change the port.
        Consequently, users and applications can continue to use the same database credentials
        post-reset, though reconnection will be necessary. Please note that any unsaved changes
        will be irretrievably lost during this operation, so ensure necessary data is backed up
        in a snapshot prior to resetting the clone."
